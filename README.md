# Building-a-world-class-report-with-GETPIVOTDATA

> In this project we'll be building a model that allows you to elaborate large quantities of data by getting the best of Pivot Table functionalities (GETPIVOTDATA, Slicers), that can improve the reporting of any firm.

> We'll be using a sample of a Fast moving consumer good industry (FMCG), that involves the production, Sales of non-durable goods such as (soft drinks, processed food & other consumable goods) It's known for its high volumes, Lower Margins & Large Product Portfolios.

#### Usually, Several firms are competing for market share & this makes financial transparency & insight even more critical.

## We'll be analyzing the data set for: 
1. What are the most profitable products
2. Which packages of these products are preferred by clients
3. What is the optimal size clients prefer to buy 
4. Furthermore, they operate with a number of key clients and need to find out what's the best course of action to take

## Our main goal is to build a model that allows the company management to see: 
1. The volumes that were sold 
2. The Revenue
3. Margins that were obtained
4. Provide a breakdown per month for
   1. Client & Client Type
   2. Brand 
   3. Size & Pack 
   
#### These are the important indicators that need to be analyzed to understand whether the company can improve its product offerings.

    3. Period (Year & Month e.g; 201601)
