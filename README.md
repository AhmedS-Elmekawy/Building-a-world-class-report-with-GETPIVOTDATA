#### Usually, there're a number of firms competing for market share & this makes financial transparency & insight even more critical.

## We'll be analyzing the data set for: 
1. what're the most profitable products
2. which packages of these products are preferred by clients
3. what's the optimal size clients prefer to buy 
4. Furthermore, they operate with a number of key clients and need to find out what's the best course of action to take

## Our main goal is to build a model that allows the company management to see: 
1. the volumes that were sold 
2. The Revenue
3. Margins that were obtained
4. Provide a breakdown per month for
  1. Client & Client Type
  2. Brand 
  3. Size & Pack 
   
#### These are the important indicators that need to be analyzed in order to understand whether the company can improve its product offerings.
